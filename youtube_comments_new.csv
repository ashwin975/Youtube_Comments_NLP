@timothys9288,"I'm a man and I think Shanghai Lily is a masterpiece and the best fragrance Tom Ford made.  It might have been marketed to women, but it's got masculine notes like clove, resins, black pepper, spices, incense and vanilla which I think make it quite unisex.  Also, I love the scent of Lily and couldn't find any other fragrance which had a masculine bend so I could wear a Lily scent....except this one.  Can't believe it got discontinued although it can still be found online in some places until it runs out of stock.   What are your thoughts on a man wearing Shanghai Lily?   It really works for me personally.  And I'm definitely masculine.",2024-06-20 10:51:22

My last buying was Soleil Neige from private collection. Check it out. In Europe the private collection is made in USA and the other is made in Switzerland.
