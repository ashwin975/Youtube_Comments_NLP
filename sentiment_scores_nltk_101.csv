@JT-rx1eo,"Beau de Jour is my favorite Tom Ford. And it's my #1 favorite ""barbershop"" Fougere out of my barbershop Fougere collection. It's the beauty of those aromatic herbs - rosemary,  basil, mint - blended into the heavy lavender and lavendin that sets it apart from my Penhaligon Sartorial,  TF Fougere D'Argent,  MDCI Invasion Barbare,  YSL Rive Gauche Pour Homme,  etc.",Beau de Jour,0.8689
@lazarostan,"Hi Demi.  
When i smell for the first time a Tom ford fragrance i can say i fell in love. I understood it was something different. So i start with tom ford - tom ford, noir extreme, oud wood, grey vetiver, tuscan leather, fcking fabulous, beau de jour from the private collection which discontinued, but you can find it in better price. My last buying was Soleil Neige from private collection. Check it out. In Europe the private collection is made in USA and the other is made in Switzerland.

@jaycagle8416,Can’t believe you almost for Tobacco Vanille! That was first love of TF and it is one of my favorite houses.  Longevity is an issue with some but beautiful DNA. Beau de Jour was a great rerelease and I’m Very happy to see Lavender Extreme make the list. It’s also one of my favs and doesn’t get much love. Solid list but I would have to add Plum Japonais and maybe Rose Prick to my list. Enjoyed!!,Beau de Jour,0.9872
@ptock1975,"Hi Demi. Great video as always. I know it's a bit late, but I want to get a clean TF and was thinking about Beau de Jour or Coasta Azzurri. BdJ sounds better, kinda like Platinum Egoiste. Which should I get? Thanks for Ireland",Beau de Jour,0.9521
